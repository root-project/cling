Cling - The Interactive C++ Interpreter
=========================================

The main repository is at [https://github.com/root-project/cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling)


Overview
--------
Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and LLVM compiler
infrastructure. Cling implements the [read-eval-print loop
(REPL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as a
small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses their strengths such
as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics.

Installation
------------
### Release Notes
See our [release notes](docs/ReleaseNotes.md) to find what's new.


### Binaries
Our nightly binary snapshots are currently unavailable.


### Building from Source

#### If Clang and LLVM in cling-latest version are Already Installed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/root-project/cling.git
mkdir cling-build && cd cling-build
cmake ../cling
cmake --build .
```

#### Build Cling Along with LLVM
If Clang and LLVM are not installed, you can build them together with Cling:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/root-project/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
git checkout cling-latest
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/root-project/cling.git
mkdir cling-build && cd cling-build
cmake -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_PROJECTS=cling -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_CLING_SOURCE_DIR=../cling/ -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;NVPTX" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../llvm-project/llvm
cmake --build . --target clang cling
```

See also the instructions [on the webpage](https://root.cern/cling/cling_build_instructions/).

Usage
-----
Assuming we're in the build folder.

If Cling is built as a standalone project, you need to specify the include directory for headers:

```bash
./bin/cling -I"../cling/include" '#include <stdio.h>' 'printf("Hello World!\n");'
```

If build Cling as part of LLVM:

```bash
./bin/cling '#include <stdio.h>' 'printf("Hello World!\n");'
```

To get started run:
```bash
./bin/cling --help
```
or
```bash
./bin/cling
[cling]$ .help
```


Jupyter
-------
Cling comes with a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) kernel. After building cling,
install Jupyter and cling's kernel by following the README.md in
[tools/Jupyter](tools/Jupyter). Make sure cling is in your PATH when you start jupyter!

Releases
--------
Our release steps to follow when cutting a new release:
  1. Update [release notes](docs/ReleaseNotes.md)
  2. Remove `~dev` suffix from [VERSION](VERSION)
  3. Add a new entry in the news section of our [website](www/news.html)
  4. Commit the changes.
  5. `git tag -a v0.x -m "Tagging release v0.x"`
  6. Tag `cling-patches` of `clang.git`:
     `git tag -a cling-v0.x -m "Tagging clang for cling v0.x"`
  7. Create a draft release in github and copy the contents of the release notes.
  8. Wait for green builds.
  9. Upload binaries to github (Travis should do this automatically).
  10. Publish the tag and announce it on the mailing list.
  11. Increment the current version and append `~dev`.
