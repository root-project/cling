Conclusion
-----------------------------------

Cling is not just a REPL, it is an embeddable and extensible execution system
for efficient incremental execution of C++. Cling allows us to decide how much
we want to compile statically and how much to defer for the target
platform. Cling enables reflection and introspection information in
high-performance systems such as ROOT, or Xeus Jupyter, where it provides
efficient code for performance-critical tasks where hot-spot regions can be
annotated with specific optimization levels. We will see more concrete examples
in the slides to follow.
