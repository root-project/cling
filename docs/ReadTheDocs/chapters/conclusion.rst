Conclusion
-----------------------------------
Cling is not just a REPL, it is an embeddable and extensible execution system for efficient incremental execution of C++. Cling allows us to decide how much we want to compile statically and how much to defer for the target platform. Cling enables reflection and introspection information in high-performance systems such as ROOT, or Xeus Jupyter, where it provides efficient code for performance-critical tasks where hot-spot regions can be annotated with specific optimization levels. We will see more concrete examples in the slides to follow.
