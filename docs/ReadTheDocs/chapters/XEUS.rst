C++ in Jupyter Notebook - Xeus Cling
-----------------------------------

The Jupyter Notebook technology allows users to create and share documents that
contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It enables data
scientists to easily exchange ideas or collaborate by sharing their analyses in
a straight-forward and reproducible way.Jupyter’s official C++ kernel
(Xeus-Cling) relies on Xeus, a C++ implementation of the kernel protocol, and
Cling.  Using C++ in the Jupyter environment yields a different experience to
C++ users. For example, Jupyter’s visualization system can be used to render
rich content such as images, therefore bringing more interactivity into the
Jupyter’s world.
