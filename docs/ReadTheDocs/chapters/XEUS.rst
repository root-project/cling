C++ in Jupyter Notebook - Xeus Cling
-----------------------------------
The Jupyter Notebook technology allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It enables data scientists to easily exchange ideas or collaborate by sharing their analyses in a straight-forward and reproducible way.Jupyter’s official C++ kernel (Xeus-Cling) relies on Xeus, a C++ implementation of the kernel protocol, and Cling.
Using C++ in the Jupyter environment yields a different experience to C++ users. For example, Jupyter’s visualization system can be used to render rich content such as images, therefore bringing more interactivity into the Jupyter’s world.
