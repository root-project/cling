Interactive CUDA C++ with Cling 
-----------------------------------

The Cling CUDA extension brings the workflows of interactive C++ to GPUs,
without losing performance and compatibility to existing software.  Through this
extension, C++ and CUDA can be used interactively on the target machine,
allowing for optimization for particular models of accelerator hardware. The
extension can be run on a Jupyter setup. Cling CUDA found application in the
field of modeling of high-energy particles and radiation produced by high-energy
laser facilities. In this framework, Cling CUDA allows for an interactive
approach which enables relaunching only a wanted part of a simulation, starting
from a given point which can be decided by the user.
