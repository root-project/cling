`Relaxing the One Definition Rule in Interpreted C++ <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377555.3377901>`_

Author: Javier Lopez Gomez et al. Conference: CC '20: 29th International Conference on Compiler Construction 2020

*This paper discusses how Cling enables redefinitions of C++ entities at the prompt, and the implications of interpreting C++ and the One Definition Rule (ODR) in C++*

`Cling – The New Interactive Interpreter for ROOT 6 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/396/5/052071>`_

V Vasilev et al 2012 J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 396 052071

*This paper describes the link between Cling and ROOT. The concepts of REPL and  JIT compilation. Cling’s methods for handling errors, expression evaluation, streaming out of execution results, runtime dynamism.*

`Interactive, Introspected C++ at CERN <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2KqEV866Ro>`_

Media: YouTube  Year:2013   Author: V. Vasilev

*Vassil Vasilev (Princeton University) explains how Cling enables interactivity in C++, and  illustrates the type introspection mechanism provided by the interpreter.*

Author: Axel Naumann    Media: YouTube  Year: 2012  Googletechtalks

*Axel Naumann (CERN) discusses Cling’s most relevant features: abstract syntax tree (AST) production, wrapped functions, global initialization of a function, delay expression evaluation at runtime, and dynamic scopes.*

Author: Axel Naumann Media: YouTube Year: 2010 LLVM developers’ meeting

*This presentation introduces Cling, an ahead-of-time compiler that extends C++ for ease of use as an interpreter.*
