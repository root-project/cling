When and why was Cling developed?
--------------------------------------------

Cling is a core component of `ROOT
<https://github.com/sarabellei/rtd_tutorial/edit/main/docs/source/index.rst>`_
providing essential functionality for the analysis of the vast amounts of very
complex data produced by the experimental high-energy physics community,
enabling interactive exploration, dynamic interoperability and rapid prototyping
capabilities to C++ developers. It was first released in 2014 with the aim to
facilitate the processing of scientific data in the field of high-energy physics
as the interactive, C++ interpreter in ROOT.  ROOT is an open-source program
written primarily in C++, developed by research groups in high-energy physics
including `CERN <https://home.cern/>`_, `FERMILAB <https://www.fnal.gov/>`_ and
`Princeton <https://www.princeton.edu/>`_ , and now used by most high-energy
physics experiments. CERN is an European research organization that operates the
largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Its experiments collect
petabytes of data per year to be serialized, analyzed, and visualized as C++
objects.
