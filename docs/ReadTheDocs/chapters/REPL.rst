Cling is (also, but not only) REPL
-----------------------------------
A `read-eval-print-loop <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop>`_ (**REPL**) is an interactive programming environment that takes user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user. In order to enable interactivity in C++, Cling provides several extensions to the C++ language:
Defining functions in the global scope: Cling redefines expressions at a global level. C++ provides limited support for this, Cling possesses the necessary semantics to re-define code while the program is running, minimizing the impedance mismatch between the **REPL** and the C++ codebase, and allowing for a seamlessly interactive programing experience.

Allows for implementation of commands which provide information about the current state of the environment. eg.., has an `Application Programming Interface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API>`_ (**API**) to provide information about the current state of the environment.

*Error recovery*: Cling has an efficient error recovery system which allows it to–  handle the errors made by the user without restarting or having to redo everything from the beginning.

*Tight feedback loop*: It provides feedback about the results of the developer’s choices that is both accurate and fast. 

*Facilitates debugging*: The programmer can inspect the printed result before deciding what expression to provide for the next line of code.
